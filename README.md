# Asynchronous Code

Welcome to the ninth lesson! In this lesson, you learn about asynchronous code. The browser reads your source code files from top to bottom. It reads each line one by one. The browser doesn't move to the next line until after reading the current line. This, however, can slow down your application if the line of code takes extra time to execute. 

You can use asynchronous blocks of code tell the browser that the code inside will take extra time to execute. The browser responds by moving onto the next line while the time-consuming task executes in the background. When that code is finally done, it tells the browser and then the browser incorporates the results of that code into your application.

At the end of this lesson, you see a live coding example. The live coding session reinforces what you learn in the lesson. This lesson also helps prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from this session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

- Hour 1: [Intro to Asynchronous Code and Third-Party APIs](#intro-to-asynchronous-code-and-third-party-apis)      
- Hour 2: [Fetch Promises and Objects](#fetch-promises-and-objects)   
- Hour 3: [Live Coding](#live-coding)   

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learned during the live session.

The live coding session continues working on the live code from the previous lessons. Here are the tasks:
